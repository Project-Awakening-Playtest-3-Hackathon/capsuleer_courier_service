## Programming notes

- this code is a horrible mess that was hacked together for the hackathon. it will hopefully work but I provide no warrenty.
- I know how to write clean react code, I just couldn't be bothered

- the `syncToZustand` stuff doesn't seem to work very well, I plan to setup my own indexer and change a bunch of stuff.
  - takes a long time to load in chrome, doesn't seem to load for in-game browser.


- fun fact, `IMG_20180419_121142.jpg` (the background image) is from my 2018 trip to Iceland for Fanfest
